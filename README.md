# Inter VLAN Communication

The mini-project is focused on enabling communication among multiple VLANs with the help of a Layer-3 switch.The topology consists of a multilayer switch (3560-24PS) ,three Layer-2 switches (2960-24TT) which represent the different VLANs along with four Laptops, four PCâ€™s and three Servers.The multilayer switch works similar to a router which makes use of gateways for each connected port in order to allow transfer of data between different VLANs.
